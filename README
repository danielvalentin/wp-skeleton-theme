This is the standard template I use when starting a new WP project.

It has the pagetemplates I most use along with some often used functions like pagination, search-highlighting, etc.

Feel free to use, fork and contribute. Be aware before you use it though, that most of the text (which isn't a lot, but stuff like error messages) is in Danish, so review the pages.
